A script to search twitter for certain phrases, (geared towards stock market but could be anything)
It grabs tweets with the correct search words, strips them of punctuation then runs a very simple sentiment analysis (buy, sell, crazy etc..) and scores each tweet.
It then tweets out the results for each search phrase
